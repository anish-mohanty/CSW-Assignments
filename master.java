To use the Master Theorem, we need to express the recurrence in the form:

T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)

where a is the number of subproblems, each of size n/b, and f(n) is the cost of dividing the problem into subproblems and combining the solutions.

In this case, a = 1, b = 2, and f(n) = n(2 - cos n). The function f(n) is not of the form n^k for some constant k, and it also does not satisfy the regularity condition, so we cannot apply the Master Theorem directly.

Therefore, the Master Theorem does not apply to this recurrence, and we need to use a different method to determine the runtime. One possible approach is to use the substitution method or the recursion tree method to derive a tight bound on the runtime. However, it may be difficult to obtain a closed-form expression for the runtime using these methods due to the presence of the non-constant term 2 - cos(n) in the recurrence.
